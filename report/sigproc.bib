Abstract = {In this paper we review data collected from an online, social media-administered survey developed to explore public use of social media during a series of natural disasters, predominantly in Australia and New Zealand, during January to March 2011. These data are then explored using examples taken from the experiences of those involved in administering the most widely-used community-driven Facebook page during these disasters, which focused on tropical cyclone Yasi ('Cyclone Yasi Update'). The survey was completed by 1146 respondents who had used social media in relation to the recent natural disasters. Data indicated that the public relied on a mix of formal and informal information sources, often using social media to re-post or re-tweet links from government websites felt to be of use to communities, thus acting as filters and amplifiers of 'official' information. This paper discusses how social media, specifically their core strengths of timely information exchange and promotion of},

Abstract = {Community-initiated Facebook groups emerged during the 2010/11 Queensland and Victorian floods, gaining a near instant following from local residents within, and family and friends beyond, the impacted areas. Administrators of the groups sourced their data from agencies such as the Bureau of Meteorology, State Emergency Service, Queensland and Victorian Police Departments, local councils and news media. Even more importantly, administrators published near-real time information from the general public: Facebook members posted information and questions; local residents asked for and received help and advice; and, travellers driving through the area posted and received up-to-date information on road closures and flooding. During the floods in Queensland and Victoria, Risk Frontiers used Facebook to distribute a survey to members of community groups such as CQ Flood Update-version 2 and Victorian Floods. The results indicate that most respondents began using the community groups on the fl},

Abstract = {In recent years, a number of cell phone adoption studies have been conducted. However, these studies did not consider cell phones adoption in developing countries where natural disasters frequently o c c u r . This o m i s s i o n i s s u r p r i s i n g b e c a u s e t h e p r e p a r e d n e s s literature leads us to conclude cell phone adoption can be useful. The goal of this study is to investigate the adoption of cell phones as preparedness efforts during the natural disaster seasons in Haiti. Data was collected through interviews involving 24 students from Haiti who live in natural disaster zones. Some preparedness factors influencing cell phone adoption were found: user previous disaster experience, user perceived responsibility for preparedness and user disaster related anxiety. Some innovative characteristics influencing cell phone adoption also were found: perceived relative advantage for preparedness, perceived compatibility for preparedness, perceived complexity for preparedness, subjective norms for preparedness and perceived risks for preparedness.
