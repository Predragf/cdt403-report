\section{Privacy}
As stated in earlier chapters social media is no the rise.
Most of these networks are centralised e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Google plus.
Users share anykind of private information in the belief that it is their own information only accesible by friends that they know.
This is though far from true in many cases.
